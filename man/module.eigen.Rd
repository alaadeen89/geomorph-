\usage{
module.eigen(
  A,
  A2 = NULL,
  partition.gp = NULL,
  phy = NULL,
  Cov = NULL,
  transform. = TRUE,
  only.values = TRUE,
  tol = 0.001
)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A 3D array (p x k x n) containing Procrustes shape variables for all specimens, or a matrix (n x variables)}

\item{A2}{An optional 3D array (p x k x n) containing Procrustes shape variables for all specimens, or a matrix (n x variables) for a second partition}

\item{partition.gp}{A list of which landmarks (or variables) belong in which partition: 
(e.g. A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C). Required when only 1 dataset provided.}

\item{phy}{Optional argument to include a class \code{phylo} phylogenetic tree.  Tip labels must match data names.
This argument instructs the function to estimate a phylogenetic covariance matrix based on a Brownian motion model
of evolutionary divergence.  The Cov argument allows a user to define a hypothetical covariance matrix, if different 
than a BM model.}

\item{Cov}{Optional argument to include a hypothetical covariance matrix used for non-independence of observations.
Row and column names must match data names.  If both a phy and Cov are provided, Cov will override phy.}

\item{transform.}{A logical argument for whether to use transformed residuals, if a phylogeny is provided.  If TRUE,
a GLS covariance matrix will be estimated; if FALSE, data will be centered on GLS mean but an OLS covariance matrix 
will be estimated.  The former is more representative of covariances independent of phylogeny;  the latter 
is more representative of dispersion in the tangent space.}

\item{only.values}{A logical argument for whether to only return eigenvalues.  If TRUE, vector correlations
using \code{\link{summary.module.eigen}} will not be possible.}

\item{tol}{A value between 0 and 1 to indicate a tolerance for relevant dimensions (via a broken stick model).
This value is the fraction of the standard deviation of the first eigenvector.  It helps to cut off dimensions that are 
no different in eigenvalue than independent vectors.  If tol = 0, a strict criterion is used to retain all vectors
that have larger eigenvalues than expected from independent variables.}
}
\value{
Objects of class "model.eigen" return a list of the following:
 \item{evals}{The eigenvalues of covariance matrices.}
 \item{evecs}{The eigenvectors of all covariance matrices. This is NULL if only values are returned.}
 \item{rel.dim}{The relevant dimensions based on a broken stick model.}
 \item{n.modules}{The number of modules considered.}
 \item{prop.mod.cells}{The proportion of elements (cells) in the covariance matrix corresponding to 
 modularity covariances.}
 \item{prop.int.cells}{The proportion of elements (cells) in the covariance matrix corresponding to 
 integration covariances.}
 \item{VCV}{The covariance matrix that is the basis for analysis.}
 \item{lm.hypothesis}{The landmark hypothesis, same as the partition group.}
 \item{var.hypothesis}{The landmark hypothesis expanded to coordinates (variables). If a matrix is input, 
 this is the same as lm.hypothesis, otherwise it is the lm.hypothesis repeated for each x, y, and 
 possibly z coordinates.}

\description{
Function performs eigen analysis on covariance matrices for modularity only, integration only, and
both integration and modularity (total), as a descriptive way to understand whether modularity or integration are more
prominent in a data set, for a particular modular hypothesis.
}
\details{
The function performs eigen-analysis on a covariance matrix (of shape data) four different ways: the observed covariance
matrix, a covariance matrix that has only within-module covariances (modularity) , a covariance matrix that has only 
among-module covariances (integration), and a diagonal matrix, matching the variable variances found in each other 
covariance matrix (independence).  The trace of each of these matrices is the same, meaning the sum of eigenvalues is also
the same among matrices.  However, they will differ in the distribution of eigenvalues.  How these distributions differ can provide
descriptive support for whether modularity, integration, or both are prominent components of variation in the data.

An eigen-analysis of the diagonal (independence) matrix is akin to a broken-stick model, providing eigen structure
for the case that variables are all independent.  One can determine the dimensions for which eigenvalues
exceed independent eigenvalues as "relevant dimensions".  Fewer relevant dimensions suggest stronger signal in the data,
whether due to modularity, integration, or both.  A similar number of relevant dimensions for the total covariance matrix
and either the modularity or integration covariance matrix would suggest that shape diversity is consistent
with one of these signals.  Comparison of eignevalues, or their proportion of the trace, by component, is also a valuable way to
discern whether variation is more consistent with modularity or integration.  

It is also possible to consider the consistency in eigenvector (principal component) orientation 
among the different types of covariance matrices.  Results are provided both for choice of component vector
correlations and Krzanowski (1979) correlations (mean of squared vector cross-products), using \code{\link{summary.module.eigen}}.

If a phylogeny is provided, a generalized least-squares (GLS) approach is used to estimate the mean vector (tree root values).
One has the option whether to transform residuals to obtain a GLS covariance matrix or simply center data on the GLS mean
to estimate a covariance matrix.  The latter (transform. = FALSE) centers data on the GLS mean rather than the ordinary least-squares 
(OLS) mean but does not condition residuals on the phylogenetic covariances in the estimation of variances and covariances.
